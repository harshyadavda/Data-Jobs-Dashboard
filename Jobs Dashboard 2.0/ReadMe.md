# Data Jobs Dashboard 2.0 with PowerBI

![Dashboard Page 1](/Images/Dashboard%202.0%20Image%20-%201.png)

## 📌 Introduction

Finding the right job in the data field can be confusing—there are hundreds of roles, different skill requirements, and salary ranges that change from country to country. When I started exploring data careers, I realized how difficult it was to understand which skills actually matter and what each job really pays.

To solve this for myself (and for anyone going through the same struggle), I built this Data Jobs Dashboard.

This dashboard is designed especially for job seekers, career switchers, and beginners in data who want a clear picture without getting lost in endless job posts.
With this dashboard, you can quickly see:

-The top skills required for different data roles

-The median yearly and hourly salaries in India and across multiple countries

-Which jobs pay the most in the data industry

-How often skills appear across thousands of job postings

The goal is simple:

👉 Cut through the noise and give you the information you actually need to make better career decisions.

I hope this helps anyone who is trying to understand the data job market.

## ⭐ Skills Showcased

This project helped me apply a mix of technical and analytical skills while building a clean, user-friendly dashboard:

📊 Interactive Dashboard (Single Page): Designed a smooth one-page layout that presents all insights without overwhelming the user.

🔄 Power Query (ETL): Cleaned, transformed, and structured raw job-posting data for analysis.

🧩 Data Modeling: Created a well-organized data model to ensure accurate relationships and faster performance.

🧮 DAX Features: Built custom measures for job counts, median salaries, skills per job, and other calculations.

🎛️ Interactive Elements: Added slicers, buttons, and other user-driven controls to make the dashboard fully interactive.

📈 Visualizations Used: Bar charts, cards, and other visuals to highlight key insights clearly and effectively.

## 📄 Dashboard Overview

This dashboard is built as a **single, focused page** that gives job seekers quick access to the most important job-market insights—without any clutter.

The page works like a compact control center for understanding trends in the data job market. It highlights the main metrics through **cards** such as **Job Count, Skills Per Job, Median Yearly Salary, and Median Hourly Salary**.

You can easily explore **skill popularity** by percent or count, check which skills show up the most in **job postings, and compare salaries** across different job titles and countries—all in one place. Everything is designed to be simple, clear, and useful for anyone trying to understand the data industry better.

## Conclusion

Building this dashboard gave me a clearer picture of the data job market, and I hope it does the same for anyone who uses it. Whether you're starting your career, switching fields, or just exploring what’s out there, this dashboard brings all the important information together in one place.

My goal was to make job research easier, faster, and more practical—so you can focus more on preparing for the roles you want and less on searching through endless job posts. I’ll continue improving this project as I come across new ideas or better data sources.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out!

A huge shout-out to Luke Barousse and his YouTube course “Power BI for Data Analytics – Full Course for Beginners.”
That course helped me understand Power BI step-by-step and gave me the confidence to actually build this project. Really appreciate the way he teaches — simple, clear, and fun.
